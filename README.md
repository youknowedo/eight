# eight - the active social app

Today's social media wants you to stay on the app, and therefore your screen, as long as possible. _eight_ is an app that lets you look up and hang with your friends in the real world. Notify your friends when you go out and let them know where you're at!

## Confessions

Used GitHub Copilot as an assistant and followed [lucia auth](https://lucia-auth.com/guides/email-and-password/) and [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples.html) guides for some functionalities. Base came from a rolled back version of my other app, [kader](https://github.com/youknowedo/kader).
